## Monthly Widget – SwiftUI & WidgetKit Mini Project

This mini-project was created as part of my Expertlab course, where I am learning to deepen my skills to become an iOS Software Engineer.  
One of my goals is to master more advanced iOS frameworks, including WidgetKit, to build richer and more interactive iOS experiences.

---

## Goal?

The goal of this small project was to:

- Understand how **WidgetKit** works  
- Implement a **small, functional widget**  
- Learn the basics of:
  - `TimelineProvider`
  - `AppIntent` configuration
  - `TimelineEntry`
  - `Widget families`
  - Previewing widgets with `#Preview`
  - Removing system margins
  - Dynamic UI configuration based on the current month

---

## What the widget does

The widget displays:

- The **current weekday**  
- The **day number** (big, bold typography)  
- A **month-specific emoji**  
- A **dynamic background theme** based on the month  

Each month has its own color palette & emoji using a custom configuration struct (`MonthConfig`).

## Course followed

I learned all of this by following **Sean Allen’s excellent “Monthly Widget” video tutorial**, which explains WidgetKit step by step and is great for beginners.

I strongly recommend his content — you can access the course via the following link:
